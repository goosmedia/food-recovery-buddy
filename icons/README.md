# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Progressive Web App:

- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

For now, you can use any image editing tool to create these icons, or use online PWA icon generators. The icons should represent the Food Recovery Buddy app (e.g., a food-related icon with a checkmark or task list).

The app will work without these icons, but they're required for proper PWA installation and home screen appearance.
